# BINARY SEARCHING
Binary searching is a more efficient search algorithm applicable to a sorted list or array. 
It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half and comparing the target element with the middle element. 
If the target is not found, the search continues in the half where the target is likely to be, repeating until the element is found or the search space is empty.

In this Python code, the binary search function takes a sorted array and a target value as input and performs binary search to find the target value. 
The example usage at the end initializes a sorted array, specifies a target value, performs binary search, and then prints whether the target was found and its index if applicable.
